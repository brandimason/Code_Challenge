# üéø Ski Days

An informational site that provides the resorts in North America with the weather for their location.

## Mashup Instructions for Challenge:
Create a mashup of 2 (or more!) data sources and present the results in an appropriate UI.

The data should be fetched from remote endpoints (as opposed to hard-coding raw data). The data sources, the presentation, and underlying language & framework/libraries used are all your choice.

This is an opportunity to be creative, have fun, and also show off your skills.

## Installation
1. Fork and clone this repo from Github to your local environment.
2. Navigate into your local directory and open the contents in your preferred code editor.
3. Run the command `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install the necessary packages needed to work on developing the package.
4. If you'd like to run a virtual environment, run the command `source virtualenv/bin/activate` and then `flask run` to run the backend server.
5. In a new terminal, CD into the client folder and to the src folder. Run the command `npm start`.

## Features
üèÇ  View ski resorts in North America <br>
üéø Click on the ski resort to see the weather for the day which includes: <br>
- The city name of the resort
- The temperature minimum
- Temperature maximum
- What it feels like
- The weather conditions for the day

## Notes
üèÇ What I would implement next:
- Add pagenation for ski resorts
- Add resort maps & how many lifts there are
- Add weather forecast for 5 days
- Add the closest airport to the resort
- Search bar to search for resort
