# üéø Ski Days

An informational site that provides the resorts in North America with the weather for their location.

## Installation
1. You will need API keys in order to access the API information. To retrieve your own API Key, create an account with following links: (follow the instructions to retrieve your API keys)<br>
[OpenWeatherAPI](https://openweathermap.org/forecast5)<br>
[Ski Resorts and Conditions](https://rapidapi.com/random-shapes-random-shapes-default/api/ski-resorts-and-conditions)<br>
2. Fork and clone this repo from Github to your local environment.
3. Navigate into your local directory and open the contents in your preferred code editor.
4. Navigate into the server folder and run the command `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install the necessary packages needed to work on developing the package.
5. From the server folder, create a new folder named <i>hider</i> with a file named <i>passwords.py</i>. Create your api keys named <i>api_key_ski</i> and <i>api_key_weather</i>.
4. Run the command `flask run` to run the backend server. 
<b><u>Important Note:</u></b> The Ski Resort API is allowed 10 free requests per day. Once you have hit your limit, you can restart the server with the command `flask run --debug`
5. In a new terminal, navigate into the client folder and to the src folder. Run the command `npm start`.
